## About The Project

This project we created a junior version [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) called micro-reddit, it is based on active record models, a user can create a post or create a comment of the post, it is running using the terminal, no user interface yet.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

You need to have this app or tools to start using it:
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/): better to have rails version 2.6.5.
* clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/rindrajosia/micro-redit.git```
* cd to the cloned folder and open with the terminal and run ```bundle install```
* After all the [gems](https://rubygems.org/) type ```rake db:migrate```
* Then type ```rails console```

### Usage

Once you have started the console you will be able to work with the assocs: for `Author`, `Post` and `Comment` 

### Examples:

- Creating Author: `Author.create(name: "put your name here", email:"email here", password:"set pass here ")`
- Creating post: `Post.create(title: "title here", body:"body here", author_id: author_id)`
- Creating comment: `Comment.create(body:"body of comment",post_id:post_id, author_id: author_id )`

## Test your outputs create two authors, 1 post and 1 comment:
- `u2 = author.find(2)`
- `c1 = u2.comments.first should return that author‚Äôs comment. #comments returns an array with comments, which is why we need to use #first to actually retrieve the comment itself.`
- `c1.author should return that comment‚Äôs author (u2).`
- `p1 = Post.first`
- `p1.comments.first should return the comment c1.`
- `c1.post should return the post p1.`
